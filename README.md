CSS Grid Practice Task: 

CSS Task (Grid Layout and Styling)
Create a webpage and style it using CSS:

--> Use a CSS Grid layout to display four sections: Header, Sidebar, Main Content, and Footer.

--> The Header should have a background color of dark blue and white text.

--> The Sidebar should take up 20% of the width and have a light gray background.

--> The Main Content should take up 80% of the width and have padding around the text.

--> The Footer should be centered and have a background color of dark blue with white text.

--> Ensure the layout is responsive on smaller screens (e.g., collapsing the sidebar under the main content).
